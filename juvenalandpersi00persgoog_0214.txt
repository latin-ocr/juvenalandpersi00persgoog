PREFACE. 201

Martial seems of this opinion, lib. iv. epig. xxviii. l. 7, 8.

“ Saepiua in libro memoratur Persius uno,
“ Quam lavis in tosa Marsus Amazonide.”

011 which the Scholiast observes, by way of note: “Grotior >
“ est parvos liber Satirarum Persii, quom iacens colomeo

“ Marsi, quo bellom Herculis empsit contro Amazonas? ⁴
Nor were the Satires of Persius in small esteem, even

among those of the most learned of the earlyChristianwriters
-suoh as cassiodoro, Lactantius Eusebius, st. Jerome, and
St. Austin. This is observed by Holyday, who concludes
his preface tobis translation with these remarkable words:

· “ Reader,becourteous to thyself, and let not the example of
“ an heathen condemn thee, but improve thee.'‘
