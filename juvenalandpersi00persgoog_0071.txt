Hanc rebus Latiis curam praestare solebat
Fictilis, et nullo violatus Jupiter auro.

Illa domi natas, nostraque ex arbore mensas
Tempora viderunt: hos lignum stabat in usus,
Annosam si forte nucem dejecerat Eurus.

At nunc divitibus coenandi nulla voluptas,

Nil rhombus, nil dama sapit: putere videntur
Unguenta, atque rosae; latos nisi sustinet orbes
Grande ebur, et magno sublimis pardus hiatu,
Dentibus ex illis, quos mittit porta Syenae,

Et Mauri celeres, et Mauro obscurior Indus,

Et quos deposuit Nabathaeo bellua saltu,
