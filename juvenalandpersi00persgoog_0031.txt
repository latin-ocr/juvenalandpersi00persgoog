20 JUVENALIS SATIRAE. 11111.

Gloria paucorum, et laudis, titulique cupido

Haesuri saxis cinerum custodibus; ad qua

Discutienda valent sterilis mala robora liena, 145
Quandoquidem data sunt ipsis quoque fata sepulchris.
Expende Hannibalem: quot libras in duce summo
Invenies? hic est, quem non capit Africa Mauro

Perfusa oceano, Niloque admota tepenti.

Rursus ad AEthio um populos, aliosque elephantos 150
Additur imperiis llispania3 Pyrenaeum

,Transilitz opposuit natura Alpemque niuemque: '
Diduxit scopulos, et montem rupit aceto.

J am tenet Italiam, tamen ultra pergere tendit;

Actum, inquit, nihil est, nisi Poeno milite portas 155
Frangimus, et media vexillum pono 11111110.

Ο qualis facies, et quali digna tabella,
