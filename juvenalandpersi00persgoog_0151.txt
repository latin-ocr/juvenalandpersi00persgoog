140 JUVENALIS SATIRAE. sar. xrv.

Et proferre libet fines3 majorque videtur,

Et melior vicina seges: mercaris ot hano, et
Arbusta, et densa montem qui canet oliva:
Quorum si pretio dominus non vincitur ullo,
Nocte hoves macri, lassoque famelica collo
Armenta ad virides hujus mittentur aristas3
Nec prius inde domum, quam tota novalia savos
In ventres abeant, ut credas falcibus actum.
Dicere vix possis, quam multi talia plorent,

Et quot venales injuria fecerit agros. ‘ 1
Sed qui sermones? quam foedae buccina famaei
Quid nocet hocf inquit: tunicam mihi malo lupini,
Quam si me toto laudet vicinia pago

Exigui ruris paucissima farra secantem.

Scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,

Et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vitae
