132 JUVENALIS SATIRAE. ser. xrv.

Sed leporem, aut capream, famulae J orie, et generosae
Iu saltu venantur aves: hino praeda eubili
Ponitur: inde autem, oum se matura levarit
Progenies stimulante fame, festinat ad illam,
Quam primum rupto praedam gustaverat ovo.
AEdifioator erat Oentronius et modo ourvo
Littoro Oajetae‚ summa nuno Tiburis aree,
Nunc Praenestinis in montibus, alta parabat
Oulmina villarum, Graeois, longeque petitis
Marmoribus, vincens Fortunae etque Herculis aedem; oo
Ut spado vincebat capitolia nostra Posides.
Dum sin ergo habitat Oentronius, imminuit rem,
Fregit opes, nee parva tamen mensura reliotae
Partis erat: totam hano turbavit lilius amens,
Dum meliore novas attollit marmore villas
Quidam sortiti metuentem sabbata patrem,
Nil praeter nubes, et cosli numen edoraut3
