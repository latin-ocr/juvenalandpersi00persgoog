64 JUVENALIS· SATIRAE. sar. ιι.

Fercula nuno audi nullis ornata macellis.
De Tiburtino veniet pinguissimus agro
Hoedulus, ott toto 'grege mollior, inscius herbae,
Necdum ausus virgas humilis mordere saliet t1;
Qui plus lactis habet quam sanguinis3 et montani
Asparagi, posito quos legit villica fusa
Grandia praeterea, tortoque calentia foeno
Ova adsunt ipsis oum matribus; et servatae
Parti anni, quales fuerant in vitibus uvae:
Signinum, Syriumque pyrum: de corbibus isdem
AEmula Picenis, et odoris mala recentis,
Neo metuenda tibi, siccatum frigore postquam
Autumnum,et terudi posuere pericula succi.
Haec olim nostrl rijam luxuriosa senatus
Ooena fuit: tOurius, parvo quae legerat horto,
Ipse focis brevibus ponebat oluscula. quae nunc .
Squallidus ιιι magna fastidit compede fossor,
Qui meminit, calidae sapiat quid vulva popinae.
