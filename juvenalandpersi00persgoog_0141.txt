130 JUVENALIS SATIRAE. rar. xiv.

Vox domini fremit instantis, virgamque tenentis.
Ergo miser trepidae, ne stercore foede canino
Atria displiceant 'oculis venientis amicit

Ne perfuse luto sit porticus: et tamen uno

⁴ Semodio scobis haec emundet servulus nnus:

Illud non agitas, ut sanctam filins omni

Aspiciet sine labe domum, vitioque carentem?

Gratum est, quod petriae civem populoque dedisti, ιι
Si facis, nt patriae sit idonens, utilis agria

Utilis et bellorum, et pacis rebus agendis:

Plurimum enim intererit, quibus artibus, et quibus hunc tu
Moribus instituas Serpente ciconia pullos

Nutrit‚ et inventa per devia rura lacerta: 75
llli eadem sumptis queernnt animalia pennis.

Vultur jumento, et canibus, crucibusque relictis,

Ad foetns properat, partemque cadaveris effert.

Hinc est ergo cibus magni quoque vultune, et se

Pascentis‚ propria cnm jam facit arbore nidos. oo
