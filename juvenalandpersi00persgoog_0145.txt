1³4 JUVENALIS SATIRAE. , sar-xiv.

Nec distare putant humana carne suillam,
Qua pater abstinuit3 mox et praeputia ponunt: ·
Romanas autem soliti contemnere leges,
J udaieum ediscunt, et servant, ae metuunt jus,
Tradidit arcano quodcunque volumine Moses:
Non monstrare vias, eadem nisi sacra colenti;
Quaesitum ad fontem solos deducere verpos.
Sed pater in causa, cui septima quasque fuit lux 100
Ignava, ct partem vitoe nou attigit ullam.
Sponte tamen juvenes imitantur oaetera: solam
Inviti quoque avaritiam exercere jubentur.
Fallit enim vitium specie virtutis, et umbra,
Oum sit triste habitu, vultuque et veste severum. 110
N ec dubie tanquam frugi laudatur averna,
Tanquam parcus homo, et rerum tutela suarum
