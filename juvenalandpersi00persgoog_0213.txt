200 PREFACE.

He died of a disorder in his stomach about the thirtieth
year of his age, and left behind hima large fortune3 the
bulk of which he bequeathed to his mother and sisters3
. leaving an handsome legacy tn his. friend and instructor

Cornutus, together with his study of books: Cornutus

· only accepted thebooks, and gave the money, which Persius

had left him, to the surriving sisters of Persius.

· Some heve supposed, that Persius studied obscurity in
his Satires, and that tn this we owe the difficulty of un-¹
ravelling his meaning 3 that he did this, that he mightwith
the greater safety attack and exposa the vicious of his day,
and particularly the emperor Neruae whom some of his
kcenest shafts were aimed: however this may be, I, have
endeavoured to avail myself of the explanations which the
learned have given, in order to facilitate the forming of my
own judgment, which, whether coincident with theirs or
not, I· have freely set down in the following notes, in order
that my readers may the more easily form theirs. .

As to the comparisons which have been made between
Horace, PersiuS, and Juvenal, (the former¹ of which is' so
often imitated by Persius,) I would refer the reader to Mr.
Dryden’s Dedication to the Earl of Dorset, which is prefixed
to the translation of Juvenal and Persius, by himself and
others, and where this matter is very fully considered. .For
my own part, I think it best to allow each his particular
merit, and to avoid the invidious and disagreeable task of
'making comparisons, where each is so ericellent, and wherein
prejudice and fancy'too often supersede true teste and sound .
judgment. - . - . ἶ ’

Howevcr the comparative merit of Persius may be dated«
mined, his positive excellence can hardly escape thereadcrs
of his Satires, or incline them to differ from Quintilian, who
says of him, Imt. Orator. lib. x. cap.‘ l. ‘f Multum et verce
’ “ ylario, quamvis ono libro Persiusmeruit? ’ , „
