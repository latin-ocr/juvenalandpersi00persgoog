00111111. JUVENAL'S SATIRES. 90

Prodigious faithfulness! and worthy the Tusoau books!
And which ought to be expiated by a orowned shelamb.
If l peroeive an excellent and upright man, Ι compare
This monster to a boy 01 two parts, or to wonderful fishes 65
Found under a plough, or to a mule with foal.
Auxious as if a shower had 'pour'd forth 0101101,
And a swarm of bees had settled, in a long bunoh,
On the top 010 temple, as if a river had flow'd into the sea
With wond'rousgulfs,and rushingwith awhirlpoolofmilk. 70
Do you complaiu that ten sestertiums are intercepted hy
impious fraudi what if another has lost two hundred secret
Sestertiums 11 this 11011011 0 third a larger sur'n than that,
Which the 001101 01 his wide 011011 had soaroe received?
So easy and ready it is, to eontemn the gods who are wit-

If that same thing no mortal 001 know. Behold, with how
A voihreeahe denies it, what steadiness there is of feigned
