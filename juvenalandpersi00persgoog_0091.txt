80 JUVENALIS SATIRAE. sar. mr.

Ventus adest3 inopi miserabilis arte cucurrit
Vestibus extensis, et, quod superaverat unum,
Velo, prora, suo: jam deficientibus Austris,

Spes vitae cum sole redit: tum gratus Iulo,

Atque novercali sedes praelata Lavino,

Conspicitur sublimis apex, oui candida nomen
Scrofa dedit, (laetis Phrygibus mirabile sumen,)

Et nunquam visis triginta clara mamillis.

Tandem intrat positas inclusa per aequora moles, 75
Tyrrhenamque Pharon, porrectaque brachia rursum,
Quae pelago occurrunt medio, longeque relinquunt

Quos natura dedit: sed trunca puppe magister
Interiora petit Baianae pervia cymbae

Tuti stagna sinus: gaudent ibi vertice raso

Garrula securi narrare pericula nautae.
